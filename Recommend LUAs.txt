[These Lua mods are really cool! Above are their original links]

These Lua scripts can enhance your gaming experience. They are optional and entirely up to your preference!

The reason I haven't integrated them into the source code is that keeping them as Lua mods provides greater customization options
If they were part of the source code, it would be painful for players to adjust or remove them :skull:

In future Frozen Engine projects, there may be even more fun and interesting Lua mods like these :D

ENJOY THE GAME! <3
